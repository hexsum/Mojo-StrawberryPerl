=head1 NAME

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Die
   is a Exporter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used internally, to translate output of 'die' and Carp
functions into L<Log::Report::Message|Log::Report::Message> objects.

=item B<die_decode>(STRING)

The STRING is the content of C<$@> after an eval() caught a die().
croak(), or confess().  This routine tries to convert this into
parameters for L<Log::Report::report()|Log::Report/"Report Production and Configuration">.  This is done in a very
smart way, even trying to find the stringifications of C<$!>.

Return are four elements: the error string which is used to trigger
a C<Log::Report> compatible C<die()>, and the options, reason, and
text message.  The options is a HASH which, amongst other things,
may contain a stack trace and location.

Translated components will have exception classes C<perl>, and C<die> or
C<confess>.  On the moment, the C<croak> cannot be distiguished from the
C<confess> (when used in package main) or C<die> (otherwise).

The returned reason depends on whether the translation of the current
C<$!> is found in the STRING, and the presence of a stack trace.  The
following table is used:

  errstr  stack  =>  reason
    no      no       ERROR   (die) application internal problem
    yes     no       FAULT   (die) external problem, think open()
    no      yes      PANIC   (confess) implementation error
    yes     yes      ALERT   (confess) external problem, caught

      = @{$opt{stack}} ? ($opt{errno} ? 'ALERT' : 'PANIC')
      :                  ($opt{errno} ? 'FAULT' : 'ERROR');
