=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Logger::LogReport - reroute Dancer2 logs into Log::Report

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Dancer2::Logger::LogReport
   is a Moo::Object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # This module is loaded when configured.  It does not provide
  # end-user functions or methods.

  # See DETAILS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

[The Dancer2 plugin was contributed by Andrew Beverley]

This logger allows the use of the many logging backends available
in L<Log::Report|Log::Report>.  It will process all of the Dancer2 log messages,
and also allow any other module to use the same logging facilities. The
same log messages can be sent to multiple destinations at the same time
via flexible dispatchers.

If using this logger, you may also want to use
L<Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport|Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport>

Many log back-ends, like syslog, have more levels of system messages.
Modules who explicitly load this module can use the missing C<assert>,
C<notice>, C<panic>, and C<alert> log levels.  The C<trace> name is
provided as well: when you are debugging, you add a 'trace' to your
program... it's just a better name than 'debug'.

You probably want to set a very simple C<logger_format>, because the
dispatchers do already add some of the fields that the default C<simple>
format adds.  For instance, to get the filename/line-number in messages
depends on the dispatcher 'mode' (f.i. 'DEBUG').

You also want to set the log level to C<debug>, because level filtering is
controlled per dispatcher (as well).

See L<Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport/"DETAILS"> for examples.
